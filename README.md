# Snake-Bite-Game
Players play as snakes competing to collect food scattered across the board . Every time you eat the food, your snake grows longer. Watch out, though; snakes cannot eat each other's tails, so a long snake is a tempting target! Points are awarded for eating foods.
In this Project, various concepts are included like Jframe,JPanel,ActionListener.
